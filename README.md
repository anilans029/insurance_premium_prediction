# HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUM PREDICTION: 
## Problem Statement :

The goal of this project is to give people an estimate of how much they need based on their individual health situation. After that, customers can work with any health insurance carrier and its plans and perks while keeping the projected cost from our study in mind. This can assist a person in concentrating on the health side of an insurance policy rather han the ineffective part.

# DATASET:
The dataset is taken from Kaggle site. Yo can download the dataset from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/noordeen/insurance-premium-prediction]

# Project Pipeline

### 1. Data Ingestion: 
* Data ingestion is the process in which unstructured data is extracted from one or multiple sources and then prepared for training machine learning models.

### 2. Data Validation:
* Data validation is an integral part of ML pipeline. It is checking the quality of source data before training a new mode
* It focuses on checking that the statistics of the new data are as expected (e.g. feature distribution, number of categories, etc). 

### 3. Data Transformation 
* Data transformation is the process of converting raw data into a format or structure that would be more suitable for model building.
* It is an imperative step in feature engineering that facilitates discovering insights.

### 4. Model Training
* Model training in machine learning is the process in which a machine learning (ML) algorithm is fed with sufficient training data to learn from.

### 5. Model Evaluation
* Model evaluation is the process of using different evaluation metrics to understand a machine learning modelâ€™s performance, as well as its strengths and weaknesses.
* Model evaluation is important to assess the efficacy of a model during initial research phases, and it also plays a role in model monitoring.

### 6. Model Deployement
* Deployment is the method by which we integrate a machine learning model into production environment to make practical business decisions based on data.
